# Ask Jeff the guru
### Brief
As part of a student project, create an interactive application with the purpose of being beneficial for Hyper Island students. Use basic programming knowledge including HTML, CSS & JavaScript. No frameworks allowed.

### Challenge
To use basic programming to explore advanced cases, such as a responsive bot.

### Notes
The first version is build upon the mentality of "first time using Javascript in a project". Hopefully, I'll get the opportunity to update the code and application to its proper form.

### Next step
* Adjust Jeff to ES6 instead of jQuery.
* Add proper structure to the project.
* Build Jeff on top of a framework to easier handle modules. (react/vue)
* Involve data in database rather than an separate "data"-file. Explore the option of API.
* Explore possibilities in ML to enhance user interactions.
